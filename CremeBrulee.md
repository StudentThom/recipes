# Crème Brûlée

Labels: 🤖 AI-inspired, 🇫🇷 Frech, 🍨 Desserts

## Ingredients:

- 2 cups full-fat coconut milk
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1/4 cup cornstarch
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- Pinch of salt
- 4-6 tablespoons granulated sugar (for caramelizing)

## Instructions
In a saucepan, combine the coconut milk, sugar, cornstarch, vanilla extract, and salt. Whisk until well combined and smooth.
Place the saucepan over medium heat and cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens and comes to a gentle boil. This should take about 5-7 minutes.
Once the mixture has thickened, remove it from the heat and pour it into individual ramekins or small serving dishes.
Allow the crème brûlée to cool to room temperature, then refrigerate for at least 4 hours or until set.
Before serving, sprinkle a thin layer of granulated sugar evenly over the surface of each crème brûlée.
Using a kitchen torch, carefully caramelize the sugar until it forms a golden-brown crust. Alternatively, you can place the ramekins under a broiler for 1-2 minutes until the sugar caramelizes.
Allow the caramelized sugar to cool and harden for a minute or two before serving.
Serve the vegan crème brûlée immediately and enjoy!
