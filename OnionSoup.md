# Onion Soup

Labels: ðŸ¤– AI-inspired, ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· Frech, ðŸ¥£ Soup

## Ingredients

- 4 large onions, thinly sliced
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 4 cups vegetable broth
- 1/4 cup dry white wine (optional)
- 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- Salt and pepper to taste
- French baguette, sliced
- Vegan cheese for topping (optional)

## Instructions

Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until caramelized and golden brown, about 20-25 minutes.

Add minced garlic to the pot and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes until fragrant.

Pour in the vegetable broth and white wine (if using), stirring to deglaze the bottom of the pot.

Stir in balsamic vinegar, sugar, salt, and pepper. Bring the soup to a simmer and let it cook for another 10-15 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.

While the soup is simmering, preheat your oven to broil. Arrange the sliced baguette on a baking sheet and toast in the oven until lightly golden.

Ladle the soup into oven-safe bowls and top each with a slice of toasted baguette. Optionally, sprinkle vegan cheese over the top.

Place the bowls under the broiler until the cheese is melted and bubbly, about 2-3 minutes.

Carefully remove the bowls from the oven and serve hot. Enjoy your vegan French onion soup!

## Bringing it up to taste
Adding experimental ingredients can elevate your vegan French onion soup and make it stand out. Here are a few ideas to consider:

#### Miso Paste
Stir in a tablespoon of miso paste for a savory umami boost. It adds depth of flavor and richness to the soup.
#### Coconut Milk
For a creamy twist, you can substitute a portion of the vegetable broth with coconut milk. This will impart a subtle coconut flavor and luxurious texture to the soup.
#### Thyme Infused Broth
Infuse the vegetable broth with fresh thyme sprigs while simmering the soup. This will impart a delicate herbaceous aroma and flavor.
#### Caramelized Leeks
Along with the onions, caramelize some thinly sliced leeks. Their sweet and slightly oniony flavor will complement the traditional onions beautifully.
#### Roasted Garlic
Instead of raw minced garlic, roast whole garlic cloves and add them to the soup. Roasted garlic has a milder, sweeter flavor that adds complexity to the dish.
#### Truffle Oil
Drizzle a small amount of truffle oil over the soup just before serving for an indulgent and aromatic touch.
#### Soy Sauce or Tamari
Add a splash of soy sauce or tamari for an extra umami punch. This will enhance the savory flavors of the soup.
#### Nutritional Yeast
Sprinkle some nutritional yeast into the soup for a cheesy, nutty flavor. It adds depth and richness without overpowering the other ingredients.


Feel free to experiment with these ingredients and adjust the quantities to suit your taste preferences. Enjoy the process of creating a unique and flavorful vegan French onion soup!
