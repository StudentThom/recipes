# Chocolate Mousse

Labels: ü§ñ AI-inspired, üç® Desserts

## Ingredients

- 1 can of chickpeas (you'll use the liquid from the can, called aquafaba)
- 200g of dark chocolate (at least 70% cocoa)
- 1 tablespoon of sugar (optional, depending on your preference for sweetness)
- 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract (optional)

## Instructions
Drain the liquid from the can of chickpeas into a mixing bowl. This liquid is your aquafaba.

Using a hand mixer or a stand mixer, whip the aquafaba on high speed until stiff peaks form. This may take about 5-10 minutes.

In the meantime, melt the dark chocolate in a heatproof bowl over a pot of simmering water (double boiler method), or in the microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring in between until smooth.
Once the chocolate is melted, let it cool slightly.

Gently fold the melted chocolate into the whipped aquafaba until fully incorporated.

If using sugar and vanilla extract, add them at this stage and fold them in as well.

Transfer the mousse into serving glasses or bowls.

Chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours, or until set.

Serve chilled, optionally garnished with fresh fruit or a sprinkle of cocoa powder.
