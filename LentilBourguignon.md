Labels: ü§ñ AI-inspired, üá´üá∑ Frech, üç≤ Main

## Ingredients
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 onion, diced
- 2 carrots, diced
- 2 celery stalks, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 cup dry green or brown lentils, rinsed and drained
- 2 cups vegetable broth
- 1 cup red wine (use a vegan variety)
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 teaspoon dried rosemary
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 bay leaf
- 8 ounces mushrooms, sliced
- Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)

## Instructions
Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add diced onion, carrots, and celery. Cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are softened, about 5-7 minutes.

Add minced garlic to the pot and cook for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.

Stir in the lentils, vegetable broth, red wine, tomato paste, dried thyme, dried rosemary, salt, pepper, and bay leaf. Bring the mixture to a simmer.

Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let the lentils simmer for about 30-35 minutes, or until they are tender and most of the liquid has been absorbed.

While the lentils are cooking, heat a separate skillet over medium heat. Add the sliced mushrooms and cook until they release their moisture and become golden brown, about 8-10 minutes.

Once the lentils are tender, remove the bay leaf from the pot and stir in the cooked mushrooms.

Taste and adjust seasoning if needed. If the mixture seems too thick, you can add a splash of vegetable broth or water to reach your desired consistency.

Serve the Lentil Bourguignon hot, garnished with chopped fresh parsley. It pairs well with mashed potatoes, crusty bread, or over cooked pasta.

## Bringing it up to taste
Here are some tips to help elevate the flavor of your Lentil Bourguignon. 
Experiment with these tips and adjust according to your taste preferences. With a bit of tweaking, you can make your Lentil Bourguignon truly exceptional!

#### Seasoning
Taste the dish as it cooks and adjust the seasoning as needed. Add more salt, pepper, or herbs to enhance the flavors to your liking.
#### Umami Boosters
Add ingredients like soy sauce, miso paste, or nutritional yeast to enhance the savory depth of the dish. These ingredients add umami richness and complexity.
#### Fresh Herbs
Adding fresh herbs like parsley, thyme, or rosemary just before serving can brighten up the flavors and add a burst of freshness.
#### Acid
A splash of acid, such as balsamic vinegar or lemon juice, can help balance the richness of the dish and brighten the flavors. Add it gradually, tasting as you go, until you achieve the desired balance.
#### Vegetable Stock
If you find the flavor lacking, you can use vegetable stock instead of water when cooking the lentils for an extra flavor boost.
#### Slow Cooking
Allowing the flavors to develop over a longer period can intensify the taste of the dish. Consider simmering the Lentil Bourguignon for an additional 10-15 minutes if time allows.
#### Garlic and Onion
If you're a fan of garlic and onion flavors, consider adding extra cloves of garlic or caramelized onions to enhance the depth of flavor.
#### Red Wine Reduction
You can intensify the flavor of the dish by reducing the red wine before adding it to the pot. Simmer the wine in a separate saucepan until it's reduced by half, then add it to the lentils.
#### Finish with Olive Oil
Drizzling a high-quality extra virgin olive oil over the finished dish just before serving can add richness and depth of flavor.
