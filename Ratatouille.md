## Ingredients

- 1 large eggplant
- 2 medium zucchinis
- 1 large yellow bell pepper
- 1 large red bell pepper
- 1 onion
- 3 cloves of garlic
- 4-5 ripe tomatoes
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Fresh basil leaves for garnish

## Instructions

♨️ Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).

🔪 Slice the eggplant, zucchinis, and bell peppers into thin rounds.
Dice the onion and mince the garlic.
Slice the tomatoes into thin rounds.

🧑‍🍳 In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced onion and minced garlic, and sauté until softened, about 5 minutes.

🍆 Add the sliced eggplant, zucchinis, and bell peppers to the skillet. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are slightly tender, about 8-10 minutes.

🌿 Season the vegetables with dried thyme, dried oregano, salt, and pepper.

🍅 In a large baking dish, layer the sliced tomatoes on the bottom.
Spoon the cooked vegetables on top of the sliced tomatoes, arranging them evenly.

♨️ Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the vegetables are fully cooked and tender.

♨️ Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10 minutes to allow some of the liquid to evaporate.
Once done, remove from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes.

🌿 Garnish with fresh basil leaves before serving.
